## About
This is a small tool that is developed as an exercise task for newyorker. The tool lets users log in to the test environment of newyorker and fetches all users from its server. Based on this data, it renders a custom developed D3 pie chart. 

##Running the application
- npm start : runs the app in development mode
- npm run : Builds the app for production to the build folder.
The build script are generated by react-create-app


##Technology stack
1- This project is created using create-react-app for setting up the environment quickly
2- Redux was manually wired into the boilerplate generated by create-react-app
3- D3 was used for rendering out a pieChart. It takes over data from a react component and manipulates the DOM on its own

##Architecture
1- React is used for providing view components that are written as functions of a Redux store. These components are developed for reusability and can be found in src/components
2- All changes in store occur through actions located in a single file called "src/actions.js". For now this holds most of the application logic. However, in future, it can be separated into smaller action files
3- A single pieChart component is written using D3, the component is not responsible for any data manipulation, this is taken care by the actions to decouple application logic from view. In future more charts can be developed and fed the data from the store in a similar fashion.
